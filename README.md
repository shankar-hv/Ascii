## 🚀 Overview

A simple Python script to display alphabets along with their **ASCII decimal values**. Users can choose to see either **uppercase (A–Z)** or **lowercase (a–z)** letters paired with their corresponding ASCII codes.

Perfect for beginners learning about character encoding, ASCII values, or Python loops!

## ✨ Features

- 🅰️ Display **Uppercase alphabets (A-Z)** with ASCII values  
- 🔡 Display **Lowercase alphabets (a-z)** with ASCII values  
- 🧑‍🏫 Interactive user input for choice selection  
- ✅ Handles invalid inputs with friendly prompts

## 🎯 How It Works

- The program prompts the user to select an option:  
  - `0` to display uppercase letters and their ASCII codes  
  - `1` to display lowercase letters and their ASCII codes  
- Upon selection, it prints each letter followed by its ASCII decimal equivalent using Python’s built-in `ord()` function.

2. Enter `0` to see uppercase alphabets with ASCII values.  
3. Enter `1` to see lowercase alphabets with ASCII values.  
4. If an invalid option is entered, the program will prompt to choose the correct option.
